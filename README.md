## Card Number Validation v1.0

The aim of this project was to create an easy to use app that takes a user input and option selection to check if a credit card number and country is valid. If both values, card number and country, are valid a success message will be shown and an option will be presented to save the card number and country to local storage. The list of "legal" countries were put into an array for demonstration purposes. The core function of this app is the Luhn algorithm that calculates if a credit card is valid. The app does not need to be installed. I used HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript to code the task.

### Future Improvements

- Find alternative way for country selection options.
- Make the app mobile responsive.
- Finer styling for dropdown menu.
- Include webpack to minify code.
